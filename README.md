# kmlhelper
I use Google Earth to build tracks for adventure rides I do every year.  When creating new tracks from existing ones I find I need lots of helpers that don't exist in Google Earth so I switch to this project, paste in the KML and do various edits here.  I haven't figured out a way yet to add these directly into Google Earth via an extension API which would really help track creation.
